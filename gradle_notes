Project - an entity you can build


Tasks
- -/--

Task - a set of instructions to execute

Tasks have a set of actions:
    doFirst
    doLast

    The actions are added in the action queue (doFirst goes firstm, doLast goes last)

A task action can abort execution of the action and continue to the next action of the task by throwing a StopActionException. A task action can abort execution of the task and continue to the next task by throwing a StopExecutionException.

You can add your own properties to a task. To add a property named myProperty, set ext.myProperty to an initial value:

        task myTask {
            ext.myProperty = "myValue"
        }
        task printTaskProperties << {
            println myTask.myProperty
        }
